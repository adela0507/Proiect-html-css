Coffee is a drink prepared from roasted coffee beans made from seeds 
of Coffea plant species. It is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic
 and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content,
 and is one of the most popular drinks in the world.

Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied
 closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The earliest credible 
 evidence of coffee drinking in the form of the modern beverage appears 
 in modern-day Yemen from the mid-15th century in Sufi shrines, where
 coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to <a href="Making-coffee.html" target="_blank">current 
 methods</a>. The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands
 via coastal Somali intermediaries and began cultivation.
</p>

<p> By the 16th century,
 the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa,
 later spreading to Europe. In the 20th century, coffee became a global commodity, 
creating different coffee cultures around the world.
